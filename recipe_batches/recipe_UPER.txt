Planning

Create two dictionaries:
  -First dictionary is titled pizza_ingredients and contains the total amount of ingredients available to us for making pizza
  -Second dictionary is titled pizza_recipe and contains the ingredients needed to make a single pizza

-Write a function that takes a recipe AND a list of ingredients, both in the form of dictionaries
  -If required recipe ingredients minus available ingredients is not a negative number (greater than zero)
    -add one to the batch_number
    -remove the number of ingredients used from available ingredients
  -else print (not enough ingredients)
  -Return the maximum number of pizzas we can make with the available ingredients
