-Write a function that takes a list of prices (includes both sell price and buy price)
  -Create variables for current minimum price and current maximum profit. Set current min and current max to first index
  -Profit is found by subtracting some price with another price that comes before it
  -Loop through the list
  -Profit is equal to (i + 1) minus the current minimum
  
  -Loop through the list, comparing prices with the current min and max
  -If current min is bigger than the found value, swap it
  -If current max is smaller than the found value, swap it
  -Calculate the difference between the smallest and largest price to find the max profit price
